"""
Classes are kind of like real life nouns. You can have a class called Person 
which would have tons of different properties and functions that they could do.
A Person could have a name, color, weight, etc. and have tons of functions like 
introduce, wave, fight etc.

An Instance object is essentially one individual from the class. For example, 
you could have an instant object called Ashley. This object's name would be
Ashley, its color could be red, and its weight would be 6500 lbs, etc. Next, 
Ashley would also be able to produce different results from the same functions
like introducing herself, waving differently, and fighting differently.
